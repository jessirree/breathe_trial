<h1>Depression</h1>
<img src="depression.jpg">
<p>
    Having been taboo for decades, if not centuries, mental health is now being widely discussed. During these exceptional times of pandemic, many of us are confronted with psychological problems related to isolation, anxiety, loneliness, frustrations, addictions, insecurities, depression, fears and worry – issues regularly addressed by Krishnamurti. Throughout his talks and discussions, Krishnamurti reveals that we are conditioned to have problems and that taking them personally may be a fundamental error. Moreover, the realisation that one’s loneliness, for example, is common to all humanity, is essential to understanding it, being free of it and learning what it is to be fundamentally secure and well in an uncertain world.

    ‘It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society’ is perhaps Krishnamurti’s best-known quote, shared widely across the internet. Although we cannot attribute these exact words to Krishnamurti, he made similar statements over the decades, and it is a theme he returned to repeatedly. So, if not in relation to society, how is health, specifically mental health, to be measured, and what does it mean to be truly healthy? As we shall see in this article, a specially selected collection of text and video extracts, Krishnamurti’s notion of mental health goes way beyond that of society’s, challenging the limited approach of analysts, psychologists and religions, revealing an unshakable order, harmony and sanity.

    <h1>Anxiety</h1>
    <img src="anxiety.jpg">
    <p>
        Ever wondered why you were trembling before your exam, or why your palms got sweaty before that job interview? These anxious feelings are a natural way for the body to prepare itself for an important event. You would have also noticed how you started to calm down once the event was under way; you started to breathe easier and your heart stopped thumping. Such an anxiety actually helps us perform better as it makes us more alert.
        However, some people experience anxiety or anxiety attacks for no apparent reason. If you find it hard to control your worries and if these constant feelings of anxiety affect your ability to go about your daily activities, then it might be a case of an anxiety disorder.
        
        QWhat is the difference between regular anxiety and an anxiety disorder?
        AHere is a quick checklist that you could use to see if your anxiety is a disorder:
        Regular anxiety
        
        Worrying about bills, job interviews, tests or other important events. The feeling of 'butterflies in your stomach' before a public performance or a big meeting.
        
        Fear of a dangerous object, place or situation, for instance, a stray dog barking at you on the street.
        
        Sadness or worry immediately after a traumatic event such as the loss of a loved one.
        
        Maintaining hygiene personally and in your surroundings.
        
        Breaking into a sweat before a big match.
        
        Anxiety disorder
        
        Worrying constantly and excessively for no apparent reason, making it difficult for you to perform day-to-day activities.
        
        Fearing any social or performance-related situations, in which you may be exposed to possible scrutiny by others. You fear that you will act in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing.
        
        Irrational fear of an object or place, such as fear of entering an elevator believing that an escape might be not possible.
        
        Repeated flashbacks, dreams and subsequent worry following exposure to an extremely traumatic event in the past.
        
        Performing excessive and repetitive cleaning and rearranging things and objects around you.
        
        Repeated panic attacks along with nervous feelings like “I am going to die“ for no apparent reason, and the constant fear of having another attack.

    <h1>ADHD</h1>
    <img src="adhd.jpg">
    <p>
        Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common neurobehavioral disorders presenting for treatment in children 1, 2. It carries a high rate of comorbid psychiatric problems such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, mood and anxiety disorders, and cigarette and substance use disorders 3. Across the life span, the social and societal costs of untreated ADHD are considerable, including academic and occupational underachievement, delinquency, motor vehicle safety, and difficulties with personal relationships 3-5,6.

ADHD affects an estimated 4% to 12% of school-aged children worldwide 7 with survey and epidemiologically derived data showing that 4 to 5% of college aged students and adults have ADHD 8. In more recent years, the recognition and diagnosis of ADHD in adults have been increasing although treatment of adults with ADHD continues to lag substantially behind that of children 8, 9. In contrast to a disproportionate rate of boys diagnosed with ADHD relative to girls in childhood, in adults, an equal number of men and women with ADHD are presenting for diagnosis and treatment 10.
