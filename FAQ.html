                            Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how
                            we
                            think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and
                            make
                            choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence
                            through adulthood.

                            Different kinds of therapy are more effective based on the nature of the mental health
                            condition
                            and/or symptoms and the person who has them (for example, children will benefit from a
                            therapist
                            who specializes in children’s mental health). However, there are several different types of
                            treatment and therapy that can help.

                            Mental health conditions are often treated with medication, therapy or a combination of the
                            two.
                            However, there are many different types of treatment available, including Complementary &
                            Alternative Treatments, self-help plans, and peer support. Treatments are very personal and
                            should be discussed by the person with the mental health conditions and his or her team.

                            Many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid in their recovery. There are a
                            variety
                            of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their family members and friends.
                            Some
                            support groups are peer-led, while others may be led by a mental health professional.

                            Health care professionals have differing opinions on the effectiveness of medication to
                            treat
                            mental illness. There are treatment facilities like The San Joaquin Psychotherapy Center,
                            www.breggin.com/sjpc.html, and Golden State Psychological Health Center in San Francisco,
                            www.gsphc.net, that advocate for medication-free treatment for many mental health illnesses.
                            Mental illness is a medical illness. A person does not simply "get over" mental illness
                            without
                            some form of treatment. Mental illness is generally a lifelong, chronic medical illness that
                            needs consistent treatment.

                            the illness. Some may not even require medication, and can be addressed with psychotherapies
                            like cognitive behavioral therapy.

                            Common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety affect one in four people. But
                            it’s still something that lots of people find hard to talk about, which can mean that many
                            people keep their feelings about having a mental health problem a secret, even from close
                            family and friends. You can’t always tell if someone has a mental illness – people might
                            look as though they’re fine and doing well, when actually they’re silently struggling.
                            If someone has bipolar disorder, they may show significant mood swings, or appear more
                            withdrawn if they are dealing with self-harm or negative thoughts, but everything is
                            dependent on the individual and there is no one way to know whether someone is unwell.

                            Different people will find that different treatments help to manage their mental health –
                            whether this is medication, or alternatives such as talking therapies, exercise or a
                            mixture.
                            While antidepressants can be effective for some, they are not the solution for everyone and
                            are not generally recommended as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression.
                            Anyone taking antidepressants should be made aware of the possible pros and cons for them,
                            and they should have their treatment reviewed regularly.
                            Talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and counselling are becoming
                            more widely available as part of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme.
                            Giving people a choice of treatments is key, whether that’s drugs, talking therapies, or
                            alternatives such as arts therapy or exercise.
